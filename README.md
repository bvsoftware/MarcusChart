This is a coding exercise I did for a job interview. The company didn't like that I used SpriteKit so i decided to share this in case anyone else wants to see how it works.

Coding Exercise:
* Reads a JSON file containing stock price data for closing dates
* Generates a graph showing price trends
* Animates entry into chart
